### Component Overview

The `SocialMedia` component renders a visually appealing section showcasing the social media handles of Synkerr. It utilizes animation and styling to create an engaging user experience.

### Dependencies

-   `react`: Core React library for building user interfaces.
-   `react-icons/bs`: Library providing Bootstrap-styled icons, specifically `BsLinkedin`, `BsInstagram`, and `BsTwitter`.
-   `react-awesome-reveal`: Library for implementing animations, specifically `Slide`.
-   `./SocialMedia.css`: A stylesheet containing the component's CSS rules.

### Component Props

This component doesn't accept any props. 

### Component State

-   **animate (Boolean):** Tracks whether the animation should be applied to the component. Initially set to `false`, it is updated to `true` upon mounting to trigger the animation.

### Component Structure

The `SocialMedia` component is structured as follows:

```jsx
<div className="social-media-container"> 
  <Slide> 
    <div className="bg-[#A79FFF] flex flex-col md:flex-row p-10">
      <div className="w-full md:w-[50%] p-4">
        {/* Content for the left side */}
      </div>
      <div className="w-full md:w-[50%] p-4">
        {/* Content for the right side */}
      </div>
    </div>
  </Slide>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

-   The outer `<div>` is the main container for the component, with the `social-media-container` class.
-   The `Slide` component from `react-awesome-reveal` wraps the content to apply the animation.
-   The inner `<div>` has a background color (`bg-[#A79FFF]`) and flexbox styling to arrange the content in columns.
-   Two child `<div>`s represent the left and right sides of the section.

### Component Functionality

1.  **Animation:**
    -   The `animate` state is used to toggle the `slide-in` class on the main container, which triggers the `Slide` animation from `react-awesome-reveal`. The animation is initiated after the component mounts.
2.  **Social Media Links:**
    -   The component displays links to Synkerr's social media profiles: LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter.
    -   Each link utilizes the respective icons from `react-icons/bs` and is styled with CSS classes.

### Usage

```jsx
import SocialMedia from './SocialMedia';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SocialMedia />
    </div>
  );
}
```

To use the `SocialMedia` component, simply import it into your desired React component and render it. You can also pass a `ref` prop to the component for access to its DOM element.

### Schema Tables

This component doesn't involve any data structures or database interaction, so no schema tables are needed.
