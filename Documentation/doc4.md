### Introduction

This ESLint configuration file defines the rules and settings used to lint JavaScript code in a React project. It ensures code quality, consistency, and adherence to best practices.

### Function Explanations

The configuration file defines the following properties:

- **root:**  Indicates that this is the root configuration file and no further searching for configuration files is required.
- **env:** Specifies the environment in which the code is running, in this case, a browser environment and ECMAScript 2020.
- **extends:** Defines the ESLint configurations to inherit from. It includes the following:
    - `eslint:recommended`: Recommended ESLint rules for best practices.
    - `plugin:react/recommended`: Recommended rules for React code.
    - `plugin:react/jsx-runtime`: Enables the use of JSX transform in React 18.
    - `plugin:react-hooks/recommended`:  Recommended rules for React hooks.
- **ignorePatterns:** Specifies files and directories to be ignored by ESLint.
- **parserOptions:** Configures the parser for the code, in this case, specifying the latest ECMAScript version and that the code uses modules.
- **settings:** Specifies settings for specific plugins, in this case, the React version used.
- **plugins:** Defines plugins used for additional linting functionality, in this case, `react-refresh` for hot module replacement.
- **rules:** Configures custom ESLint rules:
    - `react/jsx-no-target-blank`:  Disables the rule that warns against using `target="_blank"` in anchor tags.
    - `react-refresh/only-export-components`:  Warns if components are exported without being a React component, with an exception for constant exports.
