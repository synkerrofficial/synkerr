### 1. Introduction

The FAQ component is responsible for displaying a list of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers. It utilizes the Accordian component to provide an expandable/collapsible interface for the questions.

### 2. Dependencies

The FAQ component depends on the following libraries:

- React: For core functionality and JSX syntax.
- React-icons: For displaying arrow icons.
- Accordian.jsx: A custom component for the expandable question-answer sections.
- CSS: For styling the component.

### 3. Component Structure

#### 3.1 Props

The FAQ component does not accept any props.

#### 3.2 State

The FAQ component utilizes a single state variable:

- `toggled`: An array to track the state of the Accordian components (open or closed). Initialized as `useState(null)`.

#### 3.3 Functions

- `forwardRef`: Allows the FAQ component to be used with a ref.
- `map`: Iterates over the `datas` array to render each Accordian component.

### 4. Usage

The FAQ component can be rendered as follows:

```jsx
import FAQ from "./FAQ";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FAQ />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Schema Tables

There are no schema tables as the data is directly defined within the component.

### 6. API Specifications

There are no API specifications as the component does not interact with any external APIs.
